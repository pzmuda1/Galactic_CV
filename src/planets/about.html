    <h2>Hello on About me planet!</h2>
    <p>I am passionate JavaScript, but almost always with TypeScript developer.</p>
    <p>Despite obtaining the title of automation and robotics engineer, I quickly discovered keen interest in
      software development.</p>
    <p>My first steps were in Java, then some C# on internship. After that already as commercial developer I
    started my adventure with frontend.</p>
    <p>Since september 2016 I continue working as frontend developer, currently as technical leader.</p>
